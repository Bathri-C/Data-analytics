# Supermarket Grocery Sales Analysis

Tools Used
Python: For data manipulation and analysis
Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning
NumPy: Numerical computations
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization
Scikit-learn: Machine Learning library for modeling
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive coding environment

# Dataset
The dataset consists of transactional data from a supermarket, including information about:

Date of purchase
Product categories
Sales price and quantity
Customer demographics
Store locations
Project Workflow
Data Collection: The dataset is collected from a supermarket's sales records.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, data inconsistencies, and feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Understanding patterns and trends in the data.
Visualizing sales over time, product categories, and customer segments.
Feature Selection: Identifying key features that influence sales.
Modeling:
Machine Learning models are trained to predict future sales.
Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and accuracy.
Features
Key features used in the model include:

Date: The date of transaction.
Product Category: Categories like dairy, bakery, produce, etc.
Price: Price of the product.
Quantity: Quantity sold.
Total Sales: Total sales amount for each transaction.
Customer Demographics: Age, gender, and other relevant data points (if available).
Modeling
The following machine learning models were explored:

Linear Regression: A baseline model to predict sales.
Decision Tree Regressor: To capture non-linear relationships between features.
Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble model to improve prediction accuracy.
XGBoost: A gradient boosting method to enhance model performance.
Results
The Random Forest Regressor provided the most accurate predictions with a low RMSE and high accuracy on test data.
Sales trends were successfully predicted with high precision for specific products and categories.
Conclusion
This project successfully analyzed and predicted supermarket grocery sales using Python and Machine Learning. The model can be used by supermarket management to optimize stock levels, forecast demand, and increase profitability.

Future Improvements
Incorporate more detailed customer data to personalize sales predictions.
Experiment with additional machine learning models (e.g., Neural Networks).
Include seasonality and external factors (e.g., holidays, weather) to improve sales predictions.
